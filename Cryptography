Cryptology is a study of codes which includes cyrptography and cryptanalysis
Cryptography is a study of how to make codes. Like encryption and decryption algorithms
cryptanalysis is a study of how to break the codes for eg: Bruteforece attacks, Differential cyrptanalysis, side channel analysis etc
Cryptosystems are having several components and they are Plain text, Cipher Text, Algorithm : Its a process of converting plain text to  cipher text or vice versa, Secret Key

cryptosystem comes in a variety of different shapes or sizes
symmetric ciphers use the same secret key for encryption or decryption which has to be a sender and reciever so that it can be shared secretly
Asymmetric cipheres use different keys for encryption and decryption. They are mathematically derived. They are random. Public keys are used for encryption...
After sending the encrpted text the reciever can decrypt it with secret key. its used to share large amount of data
